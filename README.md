# Event Dashboard

## Description

Event Dashboard is a project that showcases my take on an assignment to build an event page where users can search for, add, edit, and delete events. The primary focus of this project is the "Add Event" modal, designed for an intuitive and efficient user experience.

---

## Features

- View event details by clicking on an event.
- Edit or delete existing events from the event overview.
- Add new events via the "Add Event" modal. Currently implementing Autherization.
- Real-time updates powered by a fullstack backend (Node/Express/Prisma/SQLite).
- Frontend and backend are now fully linkedâ€”no more JSON server!

## Installation Instructions

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open two terminals.

2. In **Terminal 1**, navigate to the backend folder and start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd eventPage_BE/eventPage-backEnd
   npm install
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   npm run seed
   npm run dev
   ```

3. In **Terminal 2**, navigate to the frontend folder and start the frontend server:

   ```bash
   cd eventPage_FE/eventPage
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Once both servers are running, open the localhost link provided by **Terminal 2** (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
